This project is a basic rock-paper-scissors game the player can play against the computer. There are 5 rounds in total with a final winner declared at the end. The player plays by clicking one of three button, "rock," "paper," or "scissors," and then the outcome is displayed below the buttons. After five rounds, the final winner is declared and the player is unable to play further unless they click "yes" under the "play again" text. This project demonstrates a basic understanding of javaScript functions, if else statements, and loops, as well as how to work with event listeners.
