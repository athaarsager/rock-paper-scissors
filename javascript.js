/* Main goal: Make a program that lets the user play rock paper scissors
against the computer.

Create a variable called getComputerChoice that will randomly
return either rock, paper, or scissors. Declare the variable, 
then create function ComputerChoice that uses Math.Random() *10 plus math.floor
to generate a number "i" between 0 and 9. If 0, re-generate, if 1-3, pick rock, if 3-5 pick paper,
if 6-9, pick scissors. return the output to getComputerChoice*/

let getComputerChoice


/* Write a function that plays a single round of rock paper scissors.
The function should take two parameters-the playerSelection and 
computerSelection. Return a string that declares the winner
"You lose! Paper beats Rock" etc.
--make parameter case-insensitive */

/*Write a new function called game(). Use the previous function
inside of this one to play a 5-round game that keeps a score and
reports a winner or loser at the end.
